# About my first group project

This game was made for one of my university courses, "Software Engineering." This was by far my favorite course because it allowed me to relate my academic life to a potential real-life career. 
The game can be played with 2/3/4 players or AI with two difficulty options. It has multiple settings including accessibility enabled feature
